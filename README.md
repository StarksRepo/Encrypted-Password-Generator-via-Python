# Encrypted-Password-Generator-via-Python
## Description
This project is a Python-based tool that generates secure, randomized passwords using the secrets module, designed for cryptographic-grade randomness. Each generated password is then hashed with SHA-256, providing an irreversible, secure representation suitable for safe storage. The project illustrates principles of cybersecurity like secure password practices, hashing for data integrity, and cryptographic modules in Python.
## Tools Used
* Python
* Visual Studio Code
